# Add Tailwind CSS

Followed the simple installation instructions on the Tailwind CSS website.

To check it out replaced the code in `app.css` with Tailwind CSS classes in the HTML. Specifically:

```css
.example-spacer {
  flex: 1 1 auto;
}
```

replaced with HTML in file `app.html`

```html
<span class="flex-auto"></span>
```

which was

```html
<span class="example-spacer"></span>
```
