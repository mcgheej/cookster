# Add Angular Material

To add Angular Material simply follow instruction available online.

```bat
> ng add @angular/material
```

The install asked for a theme name so selected _azure-blue_ as a starter but then played with the `src/custom-theme.scss` contents to try different themes. Finally added an example toolbar and styled it using mixins to use primary colour (azure) rather than transparent. Also set the icons to be white rather than black.
