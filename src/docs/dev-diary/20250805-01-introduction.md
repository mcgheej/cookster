# Development Diary - Cookster

This is the introduction for the Cookster developement diary. Cookster is an app that will allow us to interactively create preparation plans for lunches and dinners with friends and family. At present we create these plans in a spreadsheet and while this works it can be error prone and is difficult to change, hence the drive to build something that makes the process easier and more agile.

The development diary will be used to capture the steps taken to create the application. It will also be used to capture design decisions taken during the development process.

The diary itself is part of the Cookster project folder structure and can be found in _cookster/src/docs/dev-diary_. Files in this folder are markdown files and follow a simple file naming convention that keeps them in time order:

```bat
<yyyymmdd>-<ss>-<title>.md
```

where _\<yyyymmdd\>_ is the date the file was created (_yyyy_ - year, _mm_ - month, and _dd_ - day), _\<ss\>_ is a simple two digit numeric sequence count that rests to 01 every day and _title_ summarise the content of the file.
